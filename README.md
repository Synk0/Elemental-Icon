### What is this?
La Capitaine is an icon pack &mdash; designed to integrate with most desktop
environments. The set of icons takes inspiration from the latest iterations of
macOS and Google's Material Design through the use of visually pleasing
gradients, shadowing, and simple icon geometry.

Every image in this theme is a _scalable vector graphic_ so it will look great
at any size, on any screen. In my spare time, I work on adding new icons,
updating old ones, and making this theme more complete. Since this theme is
updated often, you should clone this git repository and pull regularly to make
sure you're always up-to-date:
```
cd ~/.icons
git clone https://github.com/Synk0/Elemental-Icon.git
```

### Configuration
La Capitaine comes with a configuration script which attempts to determine your
distribution and desktop environment. Using this information, La Capitaine
updates several system icons and icons used for mime-types.

For best integration with your distro/desktop environment, please run
`./configure` and follow the prompts.

### Troubleshooting
If something does not work as expected with La Capitaine, take a look at the
file [`Troubleshooting.md`](Troubleshooting.md). There you'll find the most
common traps, their solution and known issues. It may not be your fault.

### Roadmap
To-do:
 * Add alternative file-browser icons (requested a few times)
 * Add hardcode tray support
 * Add design guidelines and documentation to the wiki

### Recommendations
La Capitaine/Elemental looks best with a theme based on either Material Design or macOS.
Though I don't make GTK+ themes, I recommend
[Elemental](https://github.com/Synk0/Elemental) for a unique macOS
inspired look. Have fun, and happy theming!
